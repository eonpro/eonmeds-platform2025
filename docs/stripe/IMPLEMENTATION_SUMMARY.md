## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Configure Stripe Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   # Add webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard:
   https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/webhook/stripe
   
   # Copy webhook signing secret and add to AWS Secrets Manager:
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

2. **Test with Stripe CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Install Stripe CLI
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   
   # Login to Stripe
   stripe login
   
   # Forward webhooks locally
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhook/stripe
   
   # Run integration tests
   ./scripts/test-stripe-integration.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Products**:
   - Create products in Stripe Dashboard
   - Map to internal product codes
   - Set up subscription plans

### Future Enhancements (TODO)
- [ ] Admin dashboard for payment monitoring
- [ ] Automated reconciliation jobs
- [ ] Dunning email workflows
- [ ] Advanced fraud detection
- [ ] Customer statement generation
- [ ] Payout automation for tenants
- [ ] Connect migration (if scaling beyond 50 tenants)

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Required in AWS App Runner:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
PLATFORM_FEE_BPS=1000
```

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create test customer
- [ ] Save test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- [ ] Process test payment
- [ ] Verify webhook received
- [ ] Check ledger entry created
- [ ] Test refund flow
- [ ] Verify subscription creation
- [ ] Test billing portal access

## 📈 Success Metrics

Monitor these KPIs:
- Payment success rate (target: >95%)
- Webhook processing time (<500ms p95)
- Failed payment recovery rate
- Platform fee collection accuracy
- Customer dispute rate (<0.5%)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Webhook signature verification fails**
   - Ensure raw body is used (no JSON parsing)
   - Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is correct
   - Check for trailing whitespace in secret

2. **Customer creation fails**
   - Verify STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is set
   - Check network connectivity to Stripe
   - Ensure tenant exists in database

3. **Payment fails with saved card**
   - Card may be expired
   - Insufficient funds
   - Check for 3D Secure requirements
