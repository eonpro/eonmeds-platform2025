# üö® URGENT FIX: Auth0 Callback URL Mismatch

## ‚ùå THE PROBLEM
You're accessing: `https://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
But S3 websites **DON'T SUPPORT HTTPS**!

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Use CloudFront Instead (RECOMMENDED)
**Use this URL instead**: https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net

### Option 2: Add S3 HTTP URL to Auth0
1. Go to: https://manage.auth0.com/
2. Select your application (Client ID: VPA89aq0Y7N05GvX5KqkDm5JLXPknG0L)
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Find **Allowed Callback URLs** and ADD this line:
```
http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/callback
```
(Note: It's HTTP, not HTTPS!)

5. Also add to **Allowed Web Origins**:
```
http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

6. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom

## üìã COMPLETE LIST - Copy & Paste ALL These URLs

### Allowed Callback URLs (paste all):
```
https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/callback
http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/callback
http://localhost:3001/callback
```

### Allowed Logout URLs (paste all):
```
https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net
http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
http://localhost:3001
```

### Allowed Web Origins (paste all):
```
https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net
http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
http://localhost:3001
```

## üöÄ QUICK FIX - Use CloudFront Now!

Instead of the S3 URL, just go to:
üëâ https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net

This URL:
- ‚úÖ Supports HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Already in your Auth0 settings
- ‚úÖ Works immediately

## üìù Why This Happened

1. S3 static websites only work with HTTP (not HTTPS)
2. Your browser/bookmark is trying HTTPS on the S3 URL
3. Auth0 is correctly rejecting because the HTTPS S3 URL isn't in your allowed list

## ‚úÖ Summary

**DON'T USE**: `https://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website...` (HTTPS doesn't work)
**USE INSTEAD**: 
- https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net (HTTPS - Best)
- http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website... (HTTP only - if needed)
