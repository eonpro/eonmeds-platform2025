# 🔧 Fix Post-Login Redirect Issue

## Problem: After login, it's redirecting to S3 (which times out)

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX:

### Just go directly to CloudFront:
👉 **https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net**

You're already logged in! The authentication worked, it just redirected to the wrong URL.

---

## 🔧 PERMANENT FIX:

### Update Frontend to Use CloudFront URL

The frontend needs to be rebuilt with the correct URL:

```bash
cd packages/frontend

# Update the production environment file
cat > .env.production << EOF
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-dvouayl22wlz8zwq.us.auth0.com
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=VPA89aq0Y7N05GvX5KqkDm5JLXPknG0L
REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://api.eonmeds.com
REACT_APP_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/callback
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com
EOF

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Deploy to S3
aws s3 sync build/ s3://eonmeds-frontend-staging/ --delete --region us-east-1

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id EZBKJZ75WFBQ9 --paths "/*"
```

## 🎯 RIGHT NOW:

1. **You're already logged in!**
2. Just navigate to: **https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net**
3. You should see your dashboard

---

## ✅ What Happened:
1. Login was SUCCESSFUL ✅
2. Auth0 authenticated you ✅
3. It tried to redirect to S3 URL (which doesn't work with HTTPS) ❌
4. But you're authenticated! Just use CloudFront URL ✅

---

## 📝 Summary:
- **Login worked!** You're authenticated
- **Redirect failed** because S3 doesn't support HTTPS
- **Solution**: Use CloudFront URL instead
- **Your session is active** - just go to the right URL
