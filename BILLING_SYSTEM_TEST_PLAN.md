# ðŸ§ª Billing System Test Plan

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```bash
# Stripe Test Keys (use test mode keys)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 2. Database Migration
Run the migration script to ensure all tables and columns exist:
```bash
# From the backend directory
psql -U your_user -d your_database -f src/scripts/database-migration.sql
```

### 3. Migrate Existing Patients
Create Stripe customers for existing patients:
```bash
# From the backend directory
npx ts-node src/scripts/migrate-stripe-customers.ts
```

## Test Scenarios

### âœ… Test 1: Patient Registration Creates Stripe Customer
**Steps:**
1. Submit a new patient through HeyFlow webhook
2. Check database: `SELECT patient_id, stripe_customer_id FROM patients WHERE email = 'test@example.com';`
3. Verify in Stripe Dashboard that customer was created

**Expected Result:**
- Patient has `stripe_customer_id` populated
- Stripe customer exists with correct metadata

---

### âœ… Test 2: Create Invoice
**Steps:**
1. Login to the platform
2. Navigate to a patient profile
3. Click "Create Invoice"
4. Add line items (test with both custom and predefined services)
5. Set due date
6. Submit invoice

**Expected Result:**
- Invoice created with unique invoice_number
- Total amount calculated correctly
- Invoice appears in patient's invoice list

---

### âœ… Test 3: Add Payment Method
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to patient billing section

4. Complete setup

**Expected Result:**
- Payment method saved
- Card appears in saved cards list
- Can set as default payment method

**Test Cards:**
- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Requires Authentication: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

---

### âœ… Test 4: Process Payment with New Card
**Steps:**
1. Open an unpaid invoice
2. Click "Charge"
3. Select "Enter new card"
4. Enter test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Submit payment

**Expected Result:**
- Payment processes successfully
- Invoice status changes to "paid"
- Payment appears in invoice_payments table
- Stripe webhook received and processed

---

### âœ… Test 5: Process Payment with Saved Card
**Steps:**
1. Open an unpaid invoice
2. Click "Charge"
3. Select a saved card
4. Confirm payment

**Expected Result:**
- Payment processes without re-entering card
- Invoice marked as paid
- Payment recorded in database

---

### âœ… Test 6: Stripe Webhook Processing
**Steps:**
1. Process a payment through the UI
2. Check webhook logs: `SELECT * FROM stripe_webhook_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;`
3. Verify invoice updated: `SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = 'invoice_id';`

**Expected Result:**
- Webhook event recorded in database
- Invoice status updated to "paid"
- Payment recorded in invoice_payments

**Testing Webhooks Locally:**
```bash
# Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/v1/webhooks/stripe
```

---

### âœ… Test 7: Failed Payment Handling
**Steps:**
1. Create invoice
2. Try to charge with declining card: `4000 0000 0000 9995`
3. Check error handling

**Expected Result:**
- User sees clear error message
- Invoice remains unpaid
- Failed attempt logged in invoice_payments

---

### âœ… Test 8: Duplicate Payment Prevention
**Steps:**
1. Pay an invoice
2. Try to pay the same invoice again

**Expected Result:**
- System prevents duplicate payment
- Shows "Invoice already paid" message

---

### âœ… Test 9: Payment Method Management
**Steps:**
1. Add multiple payment methods
2. Set one as default
3. Remove a non-default card
4. Try to remove the default card

**Expected Result:**
- Can manage multiple cards
- Default card marked correctly
- Can remove non-default cards
- System handles default card removal appropriately

---

### âœ… Test 10: Invoice with Multiple Line Items
**Steps:**
1. Create invoice with 3+ different services
2. Mix recurring and one-time charges
3. Verify total calculation

**Expected Result:**
- All line items display correctly
- Total calculated accurately
- Recurring items marked appropriately

---

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Patient Stripe Integration
```sql
-- Patients with/without Stripe customers
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_patients,
    COUNT(stripe_customer_id) as with_stripe,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(stripe_customer_id) as without_stripe
FROM patients;
```

### Check Invoice Status
```sql
-- Invoice payment status distribution
SELECT 
    status, 
    COUNT(*) as count, 
    SUM(total_amount) as total_amount
FROM invoices
GROUP BY status;
```

### Recent Payments
```sql
-- Last 10 payments
SELECT 
    ip.*, 
    i.invoice_number, 
    p.first_name, 
    p.last_name
FROM invoice_payments ip
JOIN invoices i ON ip.invoice_id = i.id
JOIN patients p ON i.patient_id = p.patient_id
ORDER BY ip.payment_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Webhook Events
```sql
-- Recent webhook events
SELECT 
    event_type, 
    processed, 
    created_at, 
    error_message
FROM stripe_webhook_events
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Stripe Dashboard Verification

1. **Customers Tab**: Verify patients appear as customers
2. **Payments Tab**: Check successful payments appear
3. **Events Tab**: Verify webhooks are being sent
4. **Logs Tab**: Check for any API errors

## Performance Testing

### Load Test Payment Processing
1. Create 10 invoices for different patients
2. Process payments in rapid succession
3. Monitor response times and error rates

### Webhook Resilience
1. Temporarily disable webhook endpoint
2. Process payments
3. Re-enable endpoint
4. Verify Stripe retries and events are processed

## Security Testing

### 1. Payment Method Security
- Verify no full card numbers stored in database
- Check that CVV is never logged
- Ensure payment methods tied to authenticated users only

### 2. Authorization
- Try to charge invoice for another patient
- Attempt to view payment methods of another patient
- Verify Auth0 protection on all payment endpoints

### 3. Webhook Security
- Send webhook without signature - should reject
- Send webhook with invalid signature - should reject
- Verify signature validation is working

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
```bash
# Revert code deployment
git revert HEAD
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

2. **Database Rollback:**
```sql
-- Remove Stripe customer IDs if needed
UPDATE patients SET stripe_customer_id = NULL;

-- Mark invoices as pending if payment issues
UPDATE invoices SET status = 'pending' 
WHERE status = 'paid' AND payment_date > '2024-01-01';
```

3. **Stripe Cleanup:**
- Disable webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
- Switch back to test mode if in production

## Success Criteria

âœ… All test scenarios pass
âœ… No console errors in frontend
âœ… No error logs in backend
âœ… Stripe Dashboard shows successful payments
âœ… Database integrity maintained
âœ… User experience is smooth
âœ… Error messages are clear and helpful

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

1. **First 24 Hours:**
   - Monitor error logs every hour
   - Check Stripe Dashboard for failed payments
   - Review webhook success rate

2. **First Week:**
   - Daily review of payment success rate
   - Check for any stuck invoices
   - Monitor customer support tickets

3. **Ongoing:**
   - Weekly payment reconciliation
   - Monthly review of failed payments
   - Quarterly security audit
