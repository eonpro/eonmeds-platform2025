Force Railway Deployment - August 16, 2025
==========================================

This file forces Railway to pull the latest code from GitHub.

TypeScript fixes are already present in the codebase:
- billing.controller.ts has all return type fixes
- Type assertions added for Stripe properties
- express-validator dependency is installed

Railway is trying to build from commit ec44955 which doesn't exist.
This deployment should use the latest main branch code.
