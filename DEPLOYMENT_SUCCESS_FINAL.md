## 🔗 Production URLs

- **Backend API**: https://eonmeds-backend-v2-production.up.railway.app
- **Frontend**: https://eonmeds-frontend-production.up.railway.app
- **Stripe Webhook**: https://eonmeds-backend-v2-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/webhooks/stripe

## 📋 Remaining Optional Tasks

These are non-critical improvements that can be done later:

1. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add `PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable for PHI encryption
   - Set `FORCE_SSL=true` in environment variables

2. **Build Optimization**:
   - Configure `BUILD_ID` build arg in Railway Dashboard for better tracking

3. **Stripe Dashboard Cleanup**:
   - Remove old webhook endpoints that are no longer in use

## 🚀 Everything is Working!

Your platform is now fully operational with:
- Backend serving API requests
- Frontend communicating with the correct backend
- Stripe webhooks processing payments
- Authentication functioning properly
- Database connected and operational
