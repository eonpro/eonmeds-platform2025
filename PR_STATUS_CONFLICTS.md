## Resolution Instructions

### Option 1: Merge main into railway-reset (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# 1. Update your local branch
git checkout railway-reset
git pull origin railway-reset

# 2. Merge main branch
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main

# 3. Resolve conflicts in your editor
# For each conflicted file:
# - Keep security improvements from railway-reset
# - Keep Docker/Stripe updates from main
# - Remove duplicate code

# 4. After resolving all conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve conflicts with main branch"

# 5. Push to update PR
git push origin railway-reset
```

### Option 2: Rebase on main (Cleaner history)
```bash
# 1. Update your local branch
git checkout railway-reset
git pull origin railway-reset

# 2. Rebase on main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# 3. Resolve conflicts for each commit
# Follow git instructions for each conflict

# 4. Force push (after ensuring nobody else is working on the branch)
git push --force-with-lease origin railway-reset
```

## What to Keep During Conflict Resolution

### From railway-reset (your changes):
- ‚úÖ All security fixes
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)
- ‚úÖ PR template
- ‚úÖ Archived documentation files
- ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` patterns

### From main (existing code):
- ‚úÖ Docker configuration updates
- ‚úÖ Stripe billing implementations
- ‚úÖ Any production fixes
- ‚úÖ Railway deployment configurations

## After Resolution

1. **CI/CD will run automatically** when conflicts are resolved
2. **Security checks** will validate no secrets are exposed
3. **Tests** will ensure nothing broke
4. **Review the PR** to ensure all changes are correct
5. **Merge to main** once all checks pass

## Current TODO Status
- ‚úÖ Repository cleanup completed
- ‚úÖ Security hardening applied
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline created
- ‚úÖ Pull Request created
- ‚è≥ Resolve merge conflicts
- ‚è≥ Set up branch protection rules
- ‚è≥ Merge to main branch

## Next Actions Required
1. **Resolve the conflicts** using Option 1 or 2 above
2. **Push the resolved changes** to update the PR
3. **Wait for CI/CD checks** to complete
4. **Review and merge** the PR

## Notes
- The Cursor Bugbot check is already running on the PR
- Once conflicts are resolved, GitHub Actions will run the new CI/CD pipeline
- All security improvements are preserved - just need to merge with latest Docker/Stripe code

## Support
If you need help resolving specific conflicts:
- Focus on keeping BOTH sets of improvements
- The security changes don't conflict with functionality
- Most conflicts are additive (both changes can coexist)
