# ‚úÖ **Auth0 and Invoice Routes Fixed!**

## **What Was Wrong**

1. **Auth0 Redirect URI**: Was pointing to `https://your-app.vercel.app/callback` instead of CloudFront
2. **Invoice API Routes**: Were calling old `/api/v1/payments/invoices` instead of `/api/v1/invoices`
3. **Browser Cache**: Was serving old JavaScript even after multiple fixes

---

## **What I Fixed**

### **1. Auth0 Configuration** ‚úÖ
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/config/auth0.config.js`
- **Before**: Used `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` check (wasn't working)
- **After**: Hardcoded production URLs
```javascript
// Forced production URLs to ensure they work
redirectUri: 'https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/callback',
logoutUri: 'https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net',
apiBaseUrl: 'https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com',
```

### **2. Invoice API Routes** ‚úÖ
**Files Updated**:
- `PatientInvoices.tsx` - GET and DELETE routes
- `CreateInvoiceModal.tsx` - POST route  
- `EditInvoiceModal.tsx` - PUT route
- `invoice.service.ts` - All routes

**Changes**: 
- From: `/api/v1/payments/invoices`
- To: `/api/v1/invoices`

### **3. Cache-Busting** ‚úÖ
- New build hash: `main.af68eb7a.js` (was `main.81bc5c62.js`)
- CloudFront invalidation: Complete
- Headers: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`

---

## **Critical: Clear Your Browser Cache!**

The new build is deployed, but you **MUST** clear your browser cache:

### **Option 1: Hard Refresh** (Recommended)
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R` (do it twice!)
- **Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (do it twice!)

### **Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Mode**
- This bypasses all cache

### **Option 3: Clear Browser Data**
1. Chrome Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data
2. Check "Cached images and files"
3. Clear and restart

## **Verification Checklist**

After clearing cache, verify:

1. **Console should show**:
   ```javascript
   üîê Auth0 Configuration: {
     redirectUri: 'https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/callback'
   }
   ```
   **NOT** `https://your-app.vercel.app/callback`

2. **Network tab should show**:
   - Loading `main.af68eb7a.js` (NOT the old `main.81bc5c62.js`)
   - Invoice calls to `/api/v1/invoices` (NOT `/api/v1/payments/invoices`)

3. **Auth0 should**:
   - Allow login without "Callback URL mismatch" error
   - Redirect to dashboard after login

4. **Invoices should**:
   - Load without 404 errors
   - Create new invoices successfully
   - Delete invoices without errors
