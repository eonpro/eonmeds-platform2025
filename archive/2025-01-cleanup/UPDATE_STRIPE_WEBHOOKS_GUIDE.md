# Update Stripe Webhook URLs Guide

## ðŸ”„ Stripe Webhook Configuration

Now that your backend is running on AWS App Runner, you need to update your Stripe webhook endpoints.

### Current Setup
- **Old Railway URL**: `https://eonmeds-platform2025-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe`
- **New App Runner URL**: `https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe`

### Steps to Update Stripe Webhooks

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Or navigate: Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ Webhooks

2. **Find Your Current Webhook**
   - Look for the webhook pointing to Railway URL
   - It should be listening to events like:
     - `payment_intent.succeeded`
     - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
     - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`
     - `customer.subscription.created`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`

3. **Update the Endpoint URL**
   - Click on the webhook endpoint
   - Click "Update details" or edit icon
   - Change the URL to: `https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe`
   - Keep the same webhook signing secret (already stored in AWS Secrets Manager)

4. **Alternative: Create New Webhook (Recommended for Testing)**
   - Click "+ Add endpoint"
   - URL: `https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe`
   - Select events to listen to (same as above)
   - Click "Add endpoint"
   - Copy the new signing secret
   - Update AWS Secrets Manager if using new webhook:
     ```bash
     aws secretsmanager update-secret \
       --secret-id /eonmeds/api/stripe \
       --secret-string '{
         "secretKey": "sk_live_51RPS5NGzKhM7c2eG...",
         "webhookSecret": "NEW_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE"
       }' \
       --region us-east-1
     ```

5. **Test the Webhook**
   - In Stripe Dashboard, click "Send test webhook"
   - Select any event type (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`)
   - Click "Send test webhook"
   - You should see a successful response (200 OK)

### Verify Webhook is Working

Run this command to check recent webhook events:
```bash
curl -s https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1/webhooks/test
```

### Important Notes

- The App Runner endpoint is NOT blocked by JWT authentication (major improvement!)
- Keep the Railway webhook active for a few days as backup
- Monitor both webhooks during transition
- Once verified, disable the old Railway webhook

### Webhook Security

Your webhook endpoint verifies the Stripe signature to ensure requests are legitimate. The signing secret is stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager and loaded automatically by App Runner.

Once webhooks are updated, you can test the complete billing flow with real transactions!
