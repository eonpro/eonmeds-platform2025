## 🚨 Important Notes

### Stripe API Key Required
The payment system requires a valid Stripe key:
> ⚠️ **Security Warning:**  
> Never commit your Stripe API keys to source control.  
> Store them securely using environment variables or a secrets manager.

**How to set your Stripe keys:**

1. **In AWS App Runner or your deployment environment:**
   - Set the following environment variables (do NOT hardcode in code or config files):

     ```
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_KEY
     STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_KEY
     ```

2. **For local development:**  
   - Create a `.env` file (add `.env` to `.gitignore`):

     ```
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY
     STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY
     ```

   - Load these variables in your app using a library like `dotenv`.

> See [Stripe's guide on safe key management](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#safe-keys) for more info.

### Frontend URL Configuration
Update the base URL for production:
```javascript
// In payment-link.service.ts
baseUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net'
```

### Email Integration
To send payment links via email, update:
```javascript
// In email.service.ts
await sendEmail({
  to: patient.email,
  subject: `Invoice ${invoice.number} - Payment Due`,
  body: `Pay online: ${paymentLink.url}`
});
```

## 📈 What You Can Do Now

### Send Payment Links to Patients
```javascript
// Generate and send payment link
const invoice = await createInvoice(...);
const paymentLink = await generatePaymentLink(invoice.id);

// Send via email/SMS
sendToPatient(paymentLink.url);
```

### Track Payment Success
```javascript
// Webhook automatically updates invoice
// Check status anytime
const status = await checkPaymentStatus(invoiceNumber);
```
