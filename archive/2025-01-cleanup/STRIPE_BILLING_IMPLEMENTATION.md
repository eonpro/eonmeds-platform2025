# Stripe Billing Implementation Complete ðŸŽ‰

## Summary

I've successfully implemented a production-grade Stripe billing system in your backend with comprehensive functionality for handling payments, invoices, and subscriptions.

## What Was Created

### 1. **Stripe Billing Service** (`packages/backend/src/services/stripe-billing.service.ts`)
A comprehensive service class that handles:

#### Customer Management
- `getOrCreateCustomer()` - Find or create Stripe customers by email
- `updateDefaultPaymentMethod()` - Set default payment methods

#### Payment Methods
- `createSetupIntent()` - Save cards for future use
- `listPaymentMethods()` - List saved cards
- `detachPaymentMethod()` - Remove saved cards

#### One-off Charges
- `createPaymentIntent()` - Process immediate payments
- `refund()` - Issue full or partial refunds

#### Invoicing
- `createInvoiceItem()` - Add line items to invoices
- `createAndFinalizeInvoice()` - Create and finalize invoices
- `sendInvoice()` - Email invoices to customers
- `voidInvoice()` - Cancel unpaid invoices
- `markUncollectible()` - Mark as uncollectible

#### Subscriptions
- `createSubscription()` - Start recurring billing
- `pauseSubscription()` - Temporarily pause billing
- `resumeSubscription()` - Resume paused subscriptions
- `cancelSubscription()` - Cancel at period end

### 2. **API Routes** (`packages/backend/src/routes/stripe-billing.routes.ts`)
RESTful endpoints mounted at `/api/v1/billing/stripe`:

```
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/customers              - Create/get customer
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/setup-intent           - Start card save flow
GET    /api/v1/billing/stripe/payment-methods/:id    - List saved cards
DELETE /api/v1/billing/stripe/payment-methods/:id    - Remove card
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/default-payment-method - Set default card

POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/charge                 - One-off charge
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/refund                 - Issue refund

POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/invoices/items         - Add invoice item
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/invoices/finalize      - Finalize invoice
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/invoices/send          - Email invoice
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/invoices/void          - Void invoice

POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/subscriptions          - Create subscription
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/subscriptions/pause    - Pause subscription
POST   /api/v1/billing/stripe/subscriptions/resume   - Resume subscription
DELETE /api/v1/billing/stripe/subscriptions/:id      - Cancel subscription
```

### 3. **Database Migration** (`packages/backend/src/db/migrations/stripe-billing-tables.sql`)
Optional SQL for storing Stripe references locally:
- Added Stripe columns to invoices table
- Created subscriptions table for tracking

## Key Features

âœ… **Production-ready** with proper error handling  
âœ… **Type-safe** with full TypeScript support  
âœ… **Idempotent** customer creation by email  
âœ… **Off-session payments** for saved cards  
âœ… **Flexible invoicing** with manual or automatic collection  
âœ… **Subscription management** with pause/resume/cancel  
âœ… **Latest Stripe API** version (2025-07-30.basil)  

## Next Steps

1. **Update Stripe Secret Key in Railway**
   - Ensure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set to your live key:
   ```
   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
   ```

2. **Test the API**
   ```bash
   # Create a customer
   curl -X POST https://eonmeds-backend-v2-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/billing/stripe/customers \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Test User"}'
   ```

3. **Webhook Handling**
   Your existing webhook at `/api/v1/webhooks/stripe` should handle:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` / `invoice.payment_failed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated` / `deleted`
   - `charge.refunded`

4. **Frontend Integration**
   The frontend can now:
   - Save cards using SetupIntent
   - Charge saved payment methods
   - Manage subscriptions
   - View and pay invoices

## Security Notes

- All endpoints require JWT authentication (except webhooks)
- Stripe API key is validated and working
- Off-session payments enabled for saved cards
- Proper error handling throughout

## Deployment

Railway will automatically deploy these changes. The build succeeded locally and all TypeScript compilation passed.

Your Stripe billing system is now ready for production use! ðŸš€
