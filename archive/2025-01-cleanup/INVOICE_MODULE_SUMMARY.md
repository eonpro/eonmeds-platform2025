## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Import the Module

```typescript
import { InvoiceModule } from './modules/invoicing';

const invoicing = new InvoiceModule({
  database: pool,
  stripe: stripeClient,
  emailConfig: {
    from: 'billing@eonmeds.com',
    transport: nodemailerTransport
  }
});
```

### 2. Create an Invoice

```typescript
const invoice = await invoicing.createInvoice({
  tenantId: 'clinic-123',
  customerId: 'patient-456',
  dueDate: new Date('2025-02-01'),
  lineItems: [
    {
      description: 'Telehealth Consultation',
      quantity: 1,
      unitPrice: 150.00,
      taxRate: 0.08
    },
    {
      description: 'Lab Work',
      quantity: 1,
      unitPrice: 75.00,
      taxRate: 0.08
    }
  ],
  notes: 'Thank you for your business!'
});

console.log(`Created invoice ${invoice.number} for $${invoice.totalAmount}`);
```

### 3. Send Invoice

```typescript
await invoicing.sendInvoice(invoice.id, ['patient@example.com']);
```

### 4. Apply Payment

```typescript
await invoicing.applyPayment(invoice.id, {
  amount: 243.00,
  method: 'card',
  reference: 'pi_stripe_payment_intent_123',
  date: new Date()
});
```

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Money Storage
- All amounts stored in **cents** (integers) to avoid floating point issues
- Converted to dollars only for display

### 2. Multi-Tenancy
- Every record has `tenant_id`
- Complete data isolation between tenants
- Tenant-specific numbering schemes

### 3. HIPAA Compliance
- No PHI in invoice descriptions
- Separate internal notes for sensitive info
- Audit trail for compliance

### 4. Extensibility
- Event emitter for integration
- Custom number generators
- Custom tax calculators
- Template system for PDFs/emails

## 📊 Database Tables Created

1. **invoices_comprehensive** - Main invoice records
2. **invoice_line_items** - Line items for invoices
3. **quotes** - Quote records
4. **quote_line_items** - Line items for quotes
5. **invoice_payments** - Payment applications
6. **credit_notes** - Credit notes and adjustments
7. **recurring_invoice_templates** - Recurring invoice setup
8. **invoice_customers** - Customer records
9. **invoice_number_sequences** - Number generation
10. **invoice_audit_log** - Complete audit trail

## 🔄 Events Emitted

The module emits events for integration:

```typescript
invoicing.on('invoice.created', (invoice) => {
  // Send to accounting system
});

invoicing.on('invoice.paid', (invoice) => {
  // Trigger fulfillment
});

invoicing.on('invoice.overdue', (invoice) => {
  // Send reminder
});
```

## 🚨 Current Issues to Fix

1. **Stripe API Key** - Invalid key in production (see FIX_STRIPE_KEY_IMMEDIATELY.md)
2. **Missing Routes** - Need to mount invoice routes in backend
3. **Frontend Components** - Need to build UI

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Fix Stripe API key in AWS App Runner
2. Complete remaining services (PDF, Email, Tax)
3. Mount routes in backend

### Tomorrow
1. Build frontend components
2. Test end-to-end flow
3. Deploy to production

## 💡 Reusability

This module is **completely reusable** in other projects:

1. Copy the entire `invoicing` folder
2. Run the migration SQL
3. Configure with your database
4. Start using!

```bash
# Copy to another project
cp -r packages/backend/src/modules/invoicing /other-project/src/modules/
```
