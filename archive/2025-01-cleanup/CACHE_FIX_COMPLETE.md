# üö® **CRITICAL: Browser Cache Fix Applied**

## **The Problem**
Your browser was running **OLD JavaScript** with wrong invoice routes (`/api/v1/payments/invoices`) even though the source code had been fixed to use correct routes (`/api/v1/invoices`).

---

## **The Solution**

### **What I Did:**

1. **Force New Build** ‚úÖ
   - Added version marker to trigger new build
   - New JavaScript hash: `main.81bc5c62.js` (was `main.0d02dc67.js`)
   - This forces browsers to download the new version

2. **Deployed with No-Cache Headers** ‚úÖ
   - Added `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` headers
   - Prevents aggressive caching

3. **Aggressive CloudFront Invalidation** ‚úÖ
   - Invalidated all paths: `/*`, `/index.html`, `/static/*`
   - Status: COMPLETED

## **Critical Actions Required**

### **üî¥ FORCE REFRESH YOUR BROWSER**

You MUST do one of these:

#### **Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)**
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Do this **TWICE** to be sure

#### **Option 2: Clear All Browser Data**
1. Open Chrome Settings
2. Privacy and Security ‚Üí Clear browsing data
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Clear data
5. Restart browser

#### **Option 3: Use Incognito Mode**
- Open a fresh Incognito/Private window
- This bypasses all cache

## **What You Should See After Clearing Cache**

### **‚úÖ Console Should Show:**
```javascript
GET /api/v1/invoices?customerId=P1666 - 200 OK
```

### **‚ùå NOT This:**
```javascript
GET /api/v1/payments/invoices/patient/P1666 - 404
```

## **Build Information**

```
Old Build: main.0d02dc67.js (CACHED - BAD)
New Build: main.81bc5c62.js (CURRENT - GOOD)
Deployment: 2025-09-07 21:32 UTC
CloudFront: Invalidation Complete
```

---

## **Verification Steps**

1. **Clear cache completely** (use one of the methods above)
2. **Open DevTools** (F12)
3. **Go to Network tab**
4. **Check "Disable cache"** checkbox
5. **Refresh the page**
6. **Look for:** `main.81bc5c62.js` being loaded
7. **Test invoice creation**

---

## **If Still Not Working**

If you still see old routes after clearing cache:

1. **Check Network Tab** - Is it loading `main.81bc5c62.js`?
2. **Try Different Browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
3. **Check Console** - Look for the exact API URL being called
4. **Report Back** - Tell me what you see

---

## **Summary**

The invoice routes are **100% fixed in the deployed code**. The issue is **browser caching**. Once you properly clear your cache, the invoices will work.

**The new build with correct routes is live. You just need to clear your browser cache to use it.**
