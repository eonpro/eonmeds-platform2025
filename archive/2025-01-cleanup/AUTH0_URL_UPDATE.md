# Auth0 URL Configuration Update

## Current Issue
The application is trying to redirect to `/callback` but Auth0 only has `/dashboard` configured for eonmeds-platform2025.

## Required Addition to Auth0

### In "Allowed Callback URLs", ADD:
```
https://eonmeds-platform2025-production.up.railway.app/callback
```

Your current list has `/dashboard` but the app uses `/callback` endpoint.

### In "Allowed Logout URLs", ADD:
```
https://eonmeds-platform2025-production.up.railway.app
```

### In "Allowed Web Origins", ADD:
```
https://eonmeds-platform2025-production.up.railway.app
```

### In "Allowed Origins (CORS)", ADD:
```
https://eonmeds-platform2025-production.up.railway.app
```

## Why This Is Needed
The frontend code redirects to `/callback` after authentication (see Auth0Provider.tsx line 19), but your Auth0 configuration only allows `/dashboard` for the eonmeds domain. This mismatch causes the authentication error.

## After Adding These URLs
1. Save the changes in Auth0
2. The authentication should work immediately (no deployment needed)
3. Clear your browser cache if issues persist
