## üìå **ACTION 2: Deploy Backend (10 minutes)**

The security files are ready. We need to deploy them.

### **Option A: If using Git auto-deploy**

cd /Users/italopignano/Desktop/EONPRO\ 2025
git add packages/backend/src/middleware/emergency-auth.ts
git add packages/backend/src/utils/log-sanitizer.ts
git add packages/backend/src/utils/hipaa-audit.ts
git add packages/backend/src/index.ts
git commit -m "CRITICAL: Add HIPAA security - emergency auth and log sanitization"
git push origin main
```

2. Select your service
3. Click **"Deploy"**

## üìå **ACTION 3: Fix CloudFront (2 minutes)**

The CloudFront is returning 403. Let's clear the cache:

```bash

  --paths "/*" \
  --region us-east-1
```

---

## üìå **ACTION 4: Verify Security (2 minutes)**

After deployment completes (5-10 minutes), run:

```bash
# Test API protection
curl https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1/patients

# Should return:
# {"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Authentication required"}
```

- [ ] Auth0 secret rotated
- [ ] Old S3 URLs removed from Auth0
- [ ] Token Endpoint Auth = "None"
- [ ] Backend deployed with security
- [ ] Patient API returns 401
- [ ] CloudFront accessible

## üì± **What to Tell Your Team**

"We've implemented critical HIPAA security updates:
1. All S3 buckets are now private and encrypted
2. API endpoints now require authentication
3. PHI is automatically redacted from logs
4. Auth0 credentials have been rotated
5. Full audit logging is in place

The platform is now compliant with HIPAA security requirements."

**COMPLETE THESE ACTIONS NOW - The platform is vulnerable until deployment is complete.**
