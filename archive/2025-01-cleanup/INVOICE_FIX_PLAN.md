# üìã PLANNER MODE: Invoice & Stripe Integration Fix Plan

## **Executive Summary**
The platform is working but invoice frontend is broken due to incorrect API routes. Need immediate fix then UI enhancement.

---

## **Current State Assessment**

### ‚úÖ **Working Components**
- Platform loads and authenticates
- Patient list displays
- Stripe card addition works
- Backend invoice API fully functional
- All backend endpoints tested and working

### ‚ùå **Broken Components**
- Frontend invoice routes (404 errors)
- Invoice list not loading
- Create invoice failing
- Using old `/api/v1/payments/invoices` routes

---

## **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Problem 1: Incorrect API Routes**
```javascript
// WRONG (Current)
GET /api/v1/payments/invoices/patient/{id}
POST /api/v1/payments/invoices/create

// CORRECT (Should be)
GET /api/v1/invoices?customerId={id}
POST /api/v1/invoices
```

### **Problem 2: Components Not Updated**
- PatientInvoices.tsx - Using old routes
- CreateInvoiceModal.tsx - Using old routes with `/create` suffix

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Route Fix (30 minutes)**
1. **Fix PatientInvoices.tsx**
   - Line ~72: Change GET route
   - Line ~85: Change DELETE route
   - Success: Invoice list loads

2. **Fix CreateInvoiceModal.tsx**
   - Line ~127: Change POST route
   - Remove `/create` suffix
   - Success: Can create invoices

3. **Verify EditInvoiceModal.tsx**
   - Should already be correct
   - Success: Can edit invoices

### **Phase 2: Test & Deploy (15 minutes)**
1. **Local Test**
   - Build with correct env vars
   - Test all invoice operations
   - Check console for errors

2. **Production Deploy**
   - Build optimized version
   - Deploy to S3
   - Clear CloudFront cache
   - Verify in production

### **Phase 3: UI Enhancement (2 hours)**
Only after core functionality works:

1. **Invoice List Improvements**
   - Modern card layout
   - Status badges (Paid, Pending, Overdue)
   - Quick actions menu
   - Search and filter

2. **Create/Edit Modal**
   - Better form validation
   - Real-time calculations
   - Tax support
   - Multiple line items

3. **Payment Features**
   - Pay button integration
   - Payment confirmation
   - Receipt download
   - Refund management

---

## **Technical Details**

### **Correct API Endpoints (Backend Already Has)**
```javascript
// Invoice CRUD
POST   /api/v1/invoices              // Create
GET    /api/v1/invoices              // List (with query params)
GET    /api/v1/invoices/:id          // Get single
PUT    /api/v1/invoices/:id          // Update
DELETE /api/v1/invoices/:id          // Delete

// Invoice Actions
POST   /api/v1/invoices/:id/send     // Email invoice
GET    /api/v1/invoices/:id/payment-link  // Get payment URL
POST   /api/v1/invoices/:id/pay      // Process payment
POST   /api/v1/invoices/:id/refund   // Process refund
```

### **Frontend Service Configuration**
```javascript
// invoice.service.ts should use:
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 
  'https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com';

// Routes should be:
`${API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/invoices`
```

## **Success Metrics**
1. ‚úÖ No 404 errors in console
2. ‚úÖ Invoice list loads correctly
3. ‚úÖ Can create invoices
4. ‚úÖ Can edit invoices
5. ‚úÖ Can delete invoices
6. ‚úÖ Payment links work
7. ‚úÖ UI is modern and clean

---

## **Risk Mitigation**
- Test locally before deploying
- Make one change at a time
- Keep console open to monitor
- Clear cache after deployment
- Have rollback plan ready

---

## **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **EXECUTOR MODE**: Fix API routes in components
2. Test locally
3. Deploy to production
4. Verify functionality
5. Then enhance UI

---

## **Time Estimate**
- **Phase 1 (Routes)**: 30 minutes ‚è±Ô∏è
- **Phase 2 (Deploy)**: 15 minutes ‚è±Ô∏è
- **Phase 3 (UI)**: 2 hours ‚è±Ô∏è
- **Total**: ~3 hours to full completion

---

## **Decision Required**
Should we:
1. **Option A**: Fix routes only, deploy, then enhance UI? (Recommended)
2. **Option B**: Fix everything locally then deploy once?

**Recommendation**: Option A - Get it working first, enhance second

---

**Ready to switch to EXECUTOR MODE and implement Phase 1**
