# 🎉 HeyFlow Webhook Integration Success!

## Current Status

✅ Webhook endpoint is live and working  
✅ HeyFlow is successfully sending test data  
✅ Data structure has been identified  
⚠️ Database connection needed for full functionality

## Your Webhook URL

```
https://c72a671932eb.ngrok-free.app/api/v1/webhooks/heyflow
```

## What's Working

1. HeyFlow can send form submissions to your backend
2. The webhook responds with 200 OK status
3. All incoming data is being logged for debugging
4. Basic error handling is in place

## What's Not Working Yet

1. Database storage (no PostgreSQL connected)
2. Patient record creation (needs database)
3. Real form field mapping (using test data)
4. Security/authentication (temporarily disabled)

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Save Your Work

Click "Save changes" in HeyFlow to save the webhook configuration.

### 2. Set Up Database

You need to either:

- Install PostgreSQL locally, OR
- Set up AWS RDS (recommended)

### 3. Map Your Form Fields

Update the webhook handler to map HeyFlow's field structure to your patient data:

```javascript
// Example mapping
const firstName = fields.find((f) => f.variable === 'first_name')?.values[0]?.answer;
const email = fields.find((f) => f.variable === 'email')?.values[0]?.answer;
```

### 4. Test with Real Form

Once database is connected:

1. Create a real form in HeyFlow
2. Submit a test entry
3. Verify data saves to database

## Security Reminder

The webhook currently has security bypassed for testing. Before production:

1. Implement proper authentication
2. Re-enable signature verification
3. Add rate limiting
4. Use HTTPS only (already done with ngrok)

## Questions?

- Database setup help needed?
- Form field mapping assistance?
- Ready to implement real patient data handling?

Great job getting this far! The hardest part (webhook connectivity) is done! 🚀
