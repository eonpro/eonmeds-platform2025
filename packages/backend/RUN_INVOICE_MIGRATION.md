```

2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to the "Settings" tab

5. Click "Run Query"

## Verify Migration Success

After running the migration, you should see:

- âœ… Tables created: invoices, invoice_items, invoice_payments
- âœ… Invoice number generation test showing a number like "INV-2024-01000"
- ðŸŽ‰ Migration completed successfully!

## What This Creates

1. **invoices** table - Main invoice records
2. **invoice_items** table - Line items for each invoice
3. **invoice_payments** table - Payment history tracking
4. **generate_invoice_number()** function - Auto-generates invoice numbers
5. Various indexes for performance

Once complete, your invoice creation and fetching should work properly!
