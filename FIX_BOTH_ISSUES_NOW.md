# üö® TWO PROBLEMS TO FIX

## Problem 1: Auth0 URLs Not Added
You haven't added the callback URLs to Auth0 yet!

## Problem 2: S3 Doesn't Support HTTPS
Safari can't open `https://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website...` because S3 doesn't support HTTPS!

---

# ‚úÖ SOLUTION - Do These Steps IN ORDER:

## Step 1: Add URLs to Auth0 NOW
1. Click the **"Application Settings page"** link in your Auth0 error
2. **SCROLL DOWN** past Basic Information
3. Find these fields and paste:

### Allowed Callback URLs:
```
https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/callback, http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/callback, https://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/callback, http://localhost:3001/callback
```

### Allowed Logout URLs:
```
https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net, http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com, https://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com, http://localhost:3001
```

### Allowed Web Origins:
```
https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net, http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com, https://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com, http://localhost:3001
```

4. **SAVE CHANGES** at the bottom!

## Step 2: Use the RIGHT URL

### ‚úÖ USE THIS (CloudFront - HTTPS works):
```
https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net
```

### ‚ùå DON'T USE THESE:
- `https://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website...` (S3 doesn't support HTTPS!)
- Any S3 URL with HTTPS

---

## Step 3: Clear Browser & Start Fresh
1. Close ALL tabs
2. Open NEW incognito window
3. Go to: **https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net**
4. Click Login
5. Should work now!

---

## üìã SUMMARY:
1. **First**: Add URLs to Auth0 (you haven't done this yet!)
2. **Then**: Use CloudFront URL (not S3)
3. **Finally**: Clear browser and try again

The S3 HTTPS error proves the app is trying to work - you just need to:
- Add the URLs to Auth0
- Use CloudFront instead of S3
