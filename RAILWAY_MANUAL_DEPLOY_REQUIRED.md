# 🔴 URGENT: Railway Manual Deployment Required

## Current Status: Railway NOT Deploying Our Code

Despite pushing 6+ commits with fixes and Docker rebuilds, Railway is still serving old code.

## ✅ What We've Fixed (All on GitHub)

### Latest Commits:
- `88ad4c3` - chore(ci): force Docker rebuild with fixed TypeScript
- `14d826b` - fix(index): remove broken endpoint definitions causing TypeScript errors
- `25eb674` - chore(ci): force Docker rebuild after TypeScript fix
- `62c5975` - fix(index): remove shell comment that broke TypeScript
- `8c7a7ee` - chore(ci): force Docker rebuild for fixed index.ts
- `ae74d6f` - fix(index): remove duplicate stripeWebhookRoutes call
- `8de0a13` - chore(ci): force Docker rebuild to pick up fixed index.ts
- `e0822d2` - fix(api): add trust proxy, DEPLOY_VERSION, version/tracking routes, webhook routing

### Code Changes Complete:
✅ Trust proxy configured (`app.set('trust proxy', 1)`)  
✅ DEPLOY_VERSION logging added  
✅ Webhook routes placed before body parsers  
✅ TypeScript builds successfully  
✅ All syntax errors fixed  

### What's Missing:
❌ Version endpoint (`/version`)  
❌ Tracking endpoint (`/api/v1/tracking/test`)  
❌ Webhook alias JWT fix (`/api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe`)  

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Option 1: Manual Deploy (Recommended)
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Backend Service
2. Click **"Deploy"** button
3. Select **"Deploy from a GitHub branch"**
4. Choose branch: **main**
5. Select commit: **88ad4c3** (latest)
6. ✅ Enable **"Clear build cache"**
7. Deploy

### Option 2: Force Redeploy
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Find any recent deployment
3. Click **⋯** → **Redeploy**
4. Check "Clear build cache" if available

### Option 3: Check Settings
1. Go to Settings → Source
2. Verify:
   - Branch: **main** (not master)
   - Auto Deploy: Enabled
   - Wait for CI: Try disabling
3. Save changes

## 📋 Verification

After Railway deploys, run:
```bash
./verify-deployment.sh
```

All tests should show ✅ PASS.

## 🔍 If Still Failing

Check Railway logs for:
- Build errors
- Deployment stuck in queue
- Wrong branch/repo connected
- Permissions issues

## 💡 Last Resort

If Railway continues to deploy old code:
1. Disconnect GitHub repo
2. Reconnect to GitHub
3. Select correct repo and branch
4. Deploy manually

**The code is 100% ready. Railway just needs to be told to deploy it!**
