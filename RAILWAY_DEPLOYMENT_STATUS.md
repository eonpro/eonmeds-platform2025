# Railway Deployment Status Report

## 🔴 Current Status: Railway Not Deploying Latest Code

Despite multiple attempts and fixes, Railway is still deploying old code without our critical changes.

## ✅ What We've Successfully Fixed

### Code Changes (All Pushed to GitHub)
1. **Fixed index.ts completely:**
   - ✅ Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` right after app creation
   - ✅ Added DEPLOY_VERSION logging
   - ✅ Added `/version` endpoint
   - ✅ Added `/api/v1/tracking/test` endpoint
   - ✅ Fixed webhook routes to come before body parsers
   - ✅ Fixed duplicate stripeWebhookRoutes call
   - ✅ Removed shell comment breaking TypeScript

2. **Recent Commits Pushed:**
   - `25eb674` - chore(ci): force Docker rebuild after TypeScript fix
   - `62c5975` - fix(index): remove shell comment that broke TypeScript
   - `8c7a7ee` - chore(ci): force Docker rebuild for fixed index.ts
   - `ae74d6f` - fix(index): remove duplicate stripeWebhookRoutes call
   - `8de0a13` - chore(ci): force Docker rebuild to pick up fixed index.ts
   - `e0822d2` - fix(api): add trust proxy, DEPLOY_VERSION, version/tracking routes, webhook routing

## ❌ What's Still Broken

### Verification Results:
```
❌ /version endpoint → 404 (Not Found)
❌ /api/v1/tracking/test → 404 (Not Found)
✅ /api/v1/webhooks/stripe → 400 (Working)
❌ /api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe → 401 (JWT blocking)
```

## 🚨 Railway is NOT Deploying Our Code!

### Immediate Action Required:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard NOW**
   - Backend Service → Deployments tab
   - Check what commit is currently deployed

2. **Force Manual Deployment:**
   - Click **"Deploy"** button
   - Select **"Deploy from a GitHub branch"**
   - Choose branch: **main**
   - Select commit: **25eb674** (latest) or **8de0a13**
   - ✅ Enable **"Clear build cache"**
   - Deploy

3. **Alternative Actions:**
   - Check Settings → Verify branch is **main** (not master)
   - Disable **"Wait for CI"** if enabled
   - Check for failed deployments blocking the queue
   - Try "Redeploy" on the current deployment

## 📋 Verification Script

We have `verify-deployment.sh` ready to test when Railway deploys:

```bash
./verify-deployment.sh
```

All tests should show ✅ PASS when the correct code is deployed.

## 🎯 Success Criteria

When Railway deploys our latest code, you should see:
- Version endpoint returns JSON with commit/buildId
- Tracking test returns `{ok: true}`
- Both webhook endpoints return 400 (not 401)
- No more "trust proxy" errors in logs

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Manual deployment in Railway Dashboard** (CRITICAL)
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Run `./verify-deployment.sh`
4. If still failing, check Railway logs for build/deploy errors
5. Update Stripe webhook URL once deployment succeeds
6. Update frontend API URL to new Railway backend
