# üîß Fix Login Button Not Working

## Problem: The "nav.login" button doesn't work

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND:

### Go directly to Auth0 login URL:
```
https://dev-dvouayl22wlz8zwq.us.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=VPA89aq0Y7N05GvX5KqkDm5JLXPknG0L&redirect_uri=https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/callback&scope=openid profile email&response_type=code&response_mode=query&audience=https://api.eonmeds.com
```

Click this link or paste in browser - it will take you to login!

---

## üîç What's Happening:

1. You're on the public landing page (not logged in)
2. The "nav.login" button text is showing but the button handler isn't working
3. You need to be authenticated to access the dashboard

---

## üöÄ QUICK FIX - Use Console:

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
window.location.href = 'https://dev-dvouayl22wlz8zwq.us.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=VPA89aq0Y7N05GvX5KqkDm5JLXPknG0L&redirect_uri=https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/callback&scope=openid profile email&response_type=code&response_mode=query&audience=https://api.eonmeds.com'
```

This will redirect you to Auth0 login.

## üìù After Login:

1. Login with your credentials
2. You'll be redirected back to the app
3. You should see the dashboard (not the landing page)

---

## üîß The Issue:

The login button handler isn't connected properly. The text "nav.login" is showing instead of "Login" which suggests there's a translation/i18n issue too.

## Alternative: Check Protected Routes

Try going directly to a protected route:
- Dashboard: https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/dashboard
- Profile: https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net/profile

If you're not logged in, it should redirect you to Auth0.
