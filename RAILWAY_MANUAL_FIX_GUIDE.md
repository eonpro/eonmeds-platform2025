# Railway Manual Fix Guide - Deploy Correct Code

## ‚úÖ Good News:
- Trust proxy error is FIXED
- Database connection works
- Basic endpoints work (/health, /api/v1)

## ‚ùå Problem:
Railway is deploying OLD code without the `/version` and `/tracking` endpoints

## üõ†Ô∏è MANUAL FIX REQUIRED

### Option 1: Force Rebuild Without Cache (Recommended)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments**
2. Find your current deployment
3. Click the **"..."** menu
4. Select **"Rebuild"**
5. Choose **"Rebuild without cache"**
6. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Deploy from Specific Commit

1. **Click "Deploy" button** (top right)
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub"**
3. Choose **main** branch
4. Find commit `3d30aa6` with message "fix: Ensure version and tracking endpoints are in repository"
5. Click **Deploy**

### Option 3: Complete Service Reset

If the above don't work:

1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Source**
2. Click **"Disconnect"** GitHub
3. Wait a moment
4. Click **"Connect GitHub"**
5. Select your repository: `eonpro/eonmeds-platform2025`
6. Choose **main** branch
7. Deploy

### Option 4: Nuclear Option - New Service

If Railway is completely stuck:

1. Create a NEW Railway service
2. Name it `eonmeds-backend-v3`
3. Connect to same GitHub repo
4. Copy all environment variables
5. Deploy
6. Update domain to new service
7. Delete old service

## üß™ Test After Deployment

Run this command:
```bash
./test-final-deployment.sh
```

Expected output:
- `/version` endpoint returns version info ‚úÖ
- `/api/v1/tracking/test` endpoint works ‚úÖ

## üìù What Code Should Be Deployed

Your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` should have:
- Line 14: `app.set('trust proxy', true);`
- Line 64: `app.get('/version', ...)`
- Line 133: `app.use("/api/v1/tracking", trackingRoutes);`

## ü§î Why Is This Happening?

Railway might be:
1. Using a cached Docker image
2. Not pulling latest from GitHub
3. Building from wrong commit/branch
4. Having permission issues with GitHub

## üöÄ After Successful Deployment

1. Update Stripe webhook URL
2. Update frontend API endpoint
3. Test all integrations
