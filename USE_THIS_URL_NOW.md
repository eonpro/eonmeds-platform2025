# üö® STOP! YOU'RE USING THE WRONG URL!

## ‚ùå WRONG URL (What you're using):
```
https://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
**THIS DOESN'T WORK!** S3 static websites don't support HTTPS!

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECT URL (Use this instead):

# https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net

---

## How to Access Your App:

1. **Copy this URL exactly:**
   ```
   https://d3p4f8m2bxony8.cloudfront.net
   ```

2. **Open a NEW browser tab**

3. **Paste the URL and press Enter**

---

## Why This Happens:

- **S3 Static Websites** = HTTP only (no HTTPS)
- **CloudFront** = HTTPS enabled (secure)
- **Auth0** = Requires HTTPS for callbacks

You MUST use CloudFront for HTTPS access!

---

## Alternative (HTTP only - for testing):
If you want to test basic functionality without Auth0:
```
http://eonmeds-frontend-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
(Note: This is HTTP, not HTTPS - Auth0 login won't work here)
