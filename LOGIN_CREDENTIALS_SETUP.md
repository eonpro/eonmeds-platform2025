## üìù No Existing Users?

If Auth0 shows no users, you'll need to create one. The platform doesn't come with default users for security reasons. Use Option 2 above to create your first user!

**Remember**: I can't see your passwords - they're encrypted in Auth0. You need to either:
- Remember your existing password
- Reset it using "Forgot Password"
- Create a new user
