3. **Update Auth0 callback URLs** if needed for production domain

### Future Improvements
1. **Custom Domain**: Point `eonmeds.com` to CloudFront
2. **SSL Certificate**: Add custom SSL via AWS Certificate Manager
3. **Auto-scaling**: Configure App Runner auto-scaling rules
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployments
5. **Monitoring**: Configure CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics
