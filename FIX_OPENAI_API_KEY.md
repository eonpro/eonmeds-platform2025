# üîë Fix OpenAI API Key for BECCA AI

## The Problem
The SOAP Notes AI feature (BECCA AI) is showing: **"401 Incorrect API key provided: sk-proj-"**

This means the OpenAI API key is either:
- Not set in App Runner
- Set incorrectly
- Stored in AWS Secrets Manager but not accessible

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Log in to your OpenAI account
3. Create a new API key or use an existing one
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Add to App Runner

1. **Go to AWS App Runner Console**
   - https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner
   - Select `eonmeds-backend-staging`

2. **Click "Configuration" tab**

3. **Click "Edit configuration"**

4. **Add or Update Environment Variable:**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-[your-actual-api-key-here]
   ```

5. **Click "Apply changes"**

6. **Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment**

## üîê Alternative: Use AWS Secrets Manager (More Secure)

If you want to keep the API key secure:

### Step 1: Store in Secrets Manager
```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name /eonmeds/api/openai \
  --secret-string '{"apiKey":"sk-your-actual-key-here"}' \
  --region us-east-1
```

### Step 2: Update App Runner to Reference Secret
In App Runner configuration, under Runtime Environment Secrets:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:148534177795:secret:/eonmeds/api/openai:apiKey::
```

## üß™ Test After Deployment

Once deployed, test the SOAP Notes feature:

1. Go to any patient profile
2. Click on "SOAP Notes" tab
3. Click "Generate SOAP Note with BECCA AI"
4. It should now work!

---

## üìã Current Configuration

Looking at your backend code:
- The AI service expects: `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`
- It's used in: `packages/backend/src/services/ai.service.ts`
- The error "sk-proj-" suggests a truncated or placeholder key

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **API Key Format**: Should start with `sk-` and be about 50 characters long
2. **Billing**: Make sure your OpenAI account has billing set up
3. **Rate Limits**: New API keys might have initial rate limits
4. **Model Access**: Ensure your API key has access to the GPT model being used

---

## üöÄ Quick Terminal Check

After updating, you can verify it's working:

```bash
curl -X POST https://qm6dnecfhp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1/ai/generate-soap/P1636 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [your-auth-token]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

If it returns a SOAP note instead of an error, it's working!

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/signup
2. Create an account (if needed)
3. Add billing information
4. Generate an API key
